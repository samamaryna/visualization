## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

### My examples of good and bad visualizations:
Bad visualisation (Source: [National Rail Summary by Isuru Lokuge](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/project/17517)):

Good visualisation (Source: [Harry Potter - What the Spell? by Jonathan van der Waard](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/project/1204)):

### My answers

      ```
      ___Why bad is bad___
      The Sankey chart presented as an example of bad visual is not very nice to look at. It is overwhelming and complex. It is not a very good option for illustrating such complex railway route network. It's hard to read what information or insights the author wants to represent with this chart. The chart is misleading, since the proportion of ribbons don't represent the lenghth of the routes or any other characteristics of the routes.Ribbons are crossing each other, making the visual impossible to understand. Author was trying to show us the popularity of the routes, showing the connection between Departure and Arrival stations. There are over 60 routes, and that's the firsth reason why it's not a good choise of visual for this type of data. Probably, if there were only 4 or 5 routes the Sankey visual could be an acceptable choise. That's why I classified that visual as a bad example.  
      
      ___Why good is good___
      In my opinion good visualisation is good because it is pleasing to look at. It uses photos of main characters of the movies edited to make them look in one style, it uses nice pallette of colors, thematic fonts. Overall the visual uses one style and colors of the Harry Potter theme. The visualisation accurately represents the data, showing us the proportions of answers to the Harry Potter questions by a character. It is simple and easy to understand, at the same time it is interesting and uses nice-to-know annotations, which makes this visual not boring. That's why I classified this visual as good.   

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      ___How to improve bad visual___
      I would suggest to use different type of visual for this type of data. We have deprature and arrival stations, with this information using geographical data we can use map visualisation or network diagram for each station. The density of routes at the map diagram will show us the popularity of routes. Or even simple table with top 5 (top 10) popular routes by tickets sold would do better work for conveying the idea of the most popular routes. 

      ___How to improve good visual___
      I really like the good visual. But in my opinion it is missing either vertical grid lines or labels for each bar in this visual. It is hard to read the exact number of answers by each character without this addings.  


      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
